# TP Inheritance - C++

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize ourselves with the basic concepts and mechanisms of object-oriented languages (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.) and their implementation in C++.

To achieve this objective, we relied on a simple application aimed at offering travel routes for a trip defined by a starting city and a destination city, all based on a catalog of routes to be implemented by us. This problem involves handling an object corresponding to a collection of heterogeneous objects, which must be managed without distinction of their type by exploiting polymorphism and dynamic binding.

## Objectives

- Get familiar with the basic concepts of object-oriented languages:
  - Classes
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Learn how to express these concepts in C++.

## Application

The application aims to offer travel routes for a trip, defined by:
- A starting city
- A destination city

### Route Catalog

- Implementation of a route catalog.
- Handling an object representing a collection of heterogeneous objects.
- Managing these objects using:
  - Polymorphism
  - Dynamic binding
